The level factor says how many XP more per level you need.

`((((level + 1) * level) / 2) - 1) * LF - 100`

`((((level + 1) * level) / 2) * LF) + (level * 100)`

Most likely you just need to disconnect and connect back to any voice channel, wait a few minutes and then check your stats again.

Otherwise you're using a Bot that creates temporary voice channels. At a certain point this breaks your voice tracking (and XP). 

Either remove the voice channel bot, stop using the voice activity XP (in future you will be able to turn this off) or live with it. 

After a restart of the bot it fixes itself, BUT only for a certain amount of time!

If it's not a Bot, then the first update happens after 12 minutes (0.2) and then every 6 minutes (0.1)

0.1 = 6 min

0.5 = 30 min

1.0 = 60 min
